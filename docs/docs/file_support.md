# Audio Format Support in KFR

## Overview

KFR provides support for both raw and encoded audio formats. It handles a range of PCM bit depths, endianness, and container types.

## Uncompressed Audio

### Integer PCM

* Bit depth: 16â€“32 bits
* Signed only
* Endianness: Little and Big endian
* Channels: Any number (concrete formats may impose limits)

### Floating-Point PCM

* 32-bit and 64-bit supported
* Endianness: Little and Big endian
* Channels: Any number

## Compressed Audio

### FLAC

* Decoding and encoding supported
* Implementation uses **libFLAC**

### ALAC (Apple Lossless)

* Decoding and encoding supported
* Bit depths: 16, 20, 24, and 32-bit
* Up to 8 channels supported

### MP3

* Decoding only

## RIFF-Like Containers

KFR supports:

* Reading of arbitrary RIFF chunks
* Copying chunks directly from decoder to encoder
