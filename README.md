## KFR Installation

Compiler support:

![Clang 11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Clang-11%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)
![GCC 7+](https://img.shields.io/badge/GCC-7%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)
![MSVC 2019](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSVC-2019%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)
![Xcode 12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-12%2B-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

KFR has no external dependencies except for a C++20-compatible standard C++ library. CMake is used as the build system.

Clang is highly recommended and proven to provide the best performance for KFR. You can use Clang as a drop-in replacement for both GCC on Linux and MSVC on Windows. On macOS, Clang is the default compiler and included in the official Xcode toolchain.

_Note_: ARM/AArch64 support and building the DFT module currently requires Clang due to internal compiler errors and a lack of some optimizations in GCC and MSVC.

* Discrete Cosine Transform type II (and its inverse, also called DCT type III)
* Convolution using FFT
* Convolution filter

:arrow_right: See also [How to apply FFT](docs/docs/dft.md) with KFR

### DSP

  * Elliptic
  * Butterworth
  * Chebyshev type I and II
  * Bessel
  * Lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop filters

* Most of the standard library functions are re-implemented to support vector of any length and data type

### SIMD

* `vec<T, N>` class and related functions that abstracts cpu-specific intrinsics
* All code in the library is optimized for Intel, AMD (SSE2, SSE3, SSE4.x, AVX and AVX2 and AVX512) and ARM, AArch64 (NEON) processors
* All data types are supported including complex numbers
* All vector lengths are also supported. `vec<float,1>`, `vec<unsigned,3>`, `vec<complex<float>, 11>` all are valid vector types in KFR
* Sorting
